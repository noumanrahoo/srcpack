# Product Vision

## One-liner

CLI that bundles repo code into domain-focused context for LLMs.

## Problem

LLM context fails when it's too large, noisy, or flat. Existing tools split by size, not semantics. Teams need repeatable, indexed bundles per domain (db, API, web).

## Users

- Developers using LLMs for refactors, reviews, and design on real codebases
- Teams with multiple domains in one repo

## Principles

- Semantic splitting over size-based
- Index-first output, readable by humans and models
- Safe defaults (respects .gitignore, skips secrets)
- Zero-friction CLI

## MVP Scope

- Named bundles from one repo via simple config
- Per-bundle include/exclude globs
- Index at top (file list + tree), clear file boundaries
- Output: plain text, Markdown, or XML
- Upload to Google Drive folder

## Non-Goals

- MCP server or live streaming
- Auto-classification without config
- IDE plugins

## Success

- Bundles reused across tasks without edits
- Fewer "lost in the middle" hallucinations
- Teams converge on standard context presets
